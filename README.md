Is "Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video" a Good Movie?

The film received mixed reviews upon its release. While some viewers appreciated the comedic premise and the performances of Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri, others criticized the film for its outdated humor, weak writing, and missed opportunities. The box office performance was also moderate, indicating a lukewarm reception from the wider audience.

Analyzing the Mixed Reception:

The mixed reviews suggest that "Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video" didn't fully resonate with critics and audiences. The humor, while intended to be nostalgic, might have come across as outdated or crass to some viewers. The film's writing and screenplay could have also been tighter, with a more focused narrative and better-developed characters. The film's reliance on slapstick comedy and predictable plot points might have further contributed to its less-than-stellar reception.

The Film's Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths: The film's unique premise, the performances of the lead actors, and the nostalgic 1997 setting are considered its strengths.
Weaknesses: The outdated humor, weak writing, and predictable plot are its main drawbacks.
The Music and Soundtrack:

The film's soundtrack, composed by Sachin-Jigar, features a mix of original songs and recreated versions of popular tracks from the 90s. While the music might appeal to some viewers, it hasn't garnered significant attention or acclaim.

Box Office Performance:

"Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video" had a moderate box office run, neither a resounding success nor a complete failure. The film's collections indicate a limited appeal among the wider audience, possibly due to the mixed reviews and the competition from other releases.

Controversy and Legal Issues:

The film faced controversy for unauthorized use of characters and dialogues from Maddock Films' "Stree" franchise. This legal issue further complicated the film's reception and added to the negative publicity surrounding its release.


"Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video" attempts to blend retro charm with contemporary humor, but ultimately falls short of its potential. The film's mixed reviews, moderate box office performance, and legal controversies suggest that it didn't fully capture the audience's attention. While the film's premise might intrigue some viewers, its execution and outdated humor might not resonate with everyone. Until the film becomes available on streaming platforms, it remains a niche offering for those seeking a light-hearted, albeit flawed, comedic experience.
